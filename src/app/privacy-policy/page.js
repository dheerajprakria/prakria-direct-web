        <p>
          PRAKRIA DIRECT is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals
          who interact with us. This Policy applies to the personal information
          we collect and use for our own purposes (i.e., as a “data
          controller”). We provide this Policy to explain the ways in which we
          collect, use, and share personal information about individuals who:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            visit or interact with our websites, including{" "}
            <a href="http://www.prakriadirect.com">www.prakriadirect.com</a> and
            the other websites that PRAKRIA DIRECT operates and that link to
            this Policy (collectively, “Websites”) (“Website Visitors”);
          </li>
          <li>
            subscribe to any of our plans located on any of the Websites (our
            “Services”) through a Subscription Account (“Users”); and
          </li>
          <li>
            attend or register to attend events which we organize or co-organize
            (“Attendees”).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For purposes of this Policy “Websites”, shall refer collectively to{" "}
          <a href="http://www.prakriadirect.com">www.prakriadirect.com</a>, and
          the other websites that PRAKRIA DIRECT operates and that link to this
          Policy, the term “Services” shall refer to any of our plans located on
          any of the Websites. The term “Subscriber” refers to an individual or
          legal entity that has agreed to an applicable agreement between you
          and any member of PRAKRIA DIRECT relating to access and use of our
          Services (“Services Agreement”), including an individual representing
          the Subscribing company. The term “Account” refers to a PRAKRIA DIRECT
          account or instance created by or on behalf of a Subscriber within the
          Services. The term “Users” shall refer to the individuals authorized

        </p>
        <p>
          In providing our Services, we may process certain personal information
          on behalf of our Subscribers as a “data processor”. In such cases,
          Subscribers to our Services act as data controllers. Such Subscribers
          are solely responsible for establishing privacy policies for and
          ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,
          agreements or other obligations, relating to the processing of
          personal information of individuals who use the Subscriber’s instance
          of our Services. If you are an individual who uses a Subscriber’s
          instance of our Services, then except as otherwise noted in this
          Privacy Policy, the processing of your personal information will be
          subject to the Subscriber’s privacy practices, and you should contact
          that Subscriber for assistance with any requests or questions relating
          to the processing of your personal information.
